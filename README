DESCRIPTION
-----------
This archive contains a simple and readable ANSI C implementation of
Lempel-Ziv-Welch coding and decoding.  This implementation is not intended to
be the best, fastest, smallest, or any other performance related adjective.

BUILDING
--------
To build these files with GNU make and gcc, simply enter "make" from the
command line.  The executable will be named sample (or sample.exe).

USAGE
-----
Usage: sample <options>

options:
  -c : Encode input file to output file.
  -d : Decode input file to output file.
  -i <filename> : Name of input file.
  -o <filename> : Name of output file.
  -h|?  : Print out command line options.

-c      Compress the specified input file (see -i) using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch
        encoding algorithm.  Results are written to the specified output file
        (see -o).

-d      Decompress the specified input file (see -i) using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch
        decoding algorithm.  Results are written to the specified output file
        (see -o).  Only files compressed by this program may be decompressed.

-i <filename>   The name of the input file.  There is no valid usage of this
                program without a specified input file.

-o <filename>   The name of the output file.  If no file is specified, stdout
                will be used.  NOTE: Sending compressed output to stdout may
                produce undesirable results.

HISTORY
-------
02/20/05  - Initial Release
03/27/05  - Utilizes variable code word length
04/20/05  - Separated encoding and decoding routines
          - Uses binary tree for encoding dictionary structure
06/21/05  - Corrected BitFileGetBits/PutBits error that accessed an extra
            byte when given an integral number of bytes.
08/30/07  - Explicitly licensed under LGPL version 3.
          - Replaces getopt() with optlist library.

TODO
----
- Do something to handle the case where the string table is full and does not
  contain entries for strings that are being encoded.
  - possibly purge and regenerate table after coding drops below X% hits
  - possibly replace least recently used code word (LRU) with new code
- Speed up code word search during compression
  - try AVL or Red/Black trees
  - maybe something similar to a Fibonacci heap
- Use typedefs and more type size checking for better portability
